            When you've been in business as long as we have and faced technology's increasingly rapid developments, 
            you learn a few things. Or, in our case, more than a few. We not only have simple, 
            ready-to-implement solutions for almost every problem, we have the patents for them, too. 
            And, if you bring us something new, our engineers would love to work with you to find the solution.
